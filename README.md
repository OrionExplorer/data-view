     -F "file=@/path/to/email.eml"
```

#### **Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "file_id": "abc123xyz",
  "file_size": 204800
}
```

---

### ✅ **2. Use Case: Sending Email Data as JSON**

- **Scenario:** An external system automatically forwards emails as JSON (without `.eml` files) to convert them into PDFs for quick previews.  
- **Request Format:** `application/json`

#### **Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://data-view.local/api/email-to-pdf/" \
     -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "subject": "Project Update",
           "sender": "alice@example.com",
           "recipient": "bob@example.com",
           "body": "Hello Bob, here is the project update.",
           "attachments": [
               {
                   "filename": "report.docx",
                   "content": "BASE64_ENCODED_CONTENT"
               }

## 🚨 Error Handling

### ❌ **1. Insufficient Credits**

If the user's account does not have enough credits to process the request:

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient credits. Please top up your account.",
  "required_credits": 10,
  "available_credits": 5
}
```

---

### ❌ **2. Invalid API Key**

When an incorrect or missing API key is provided:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key."
}
```

---

### ❌ **3. File Not Found (Download Endpoint)**

If the provided `file_id` does not exist or the user lacks permission:

```json
{
  "error": "File does not exist or you do not have access."
}
```

---

## 🔑 **Authentication**

All API requests require an `x-api-key` header for authentication.

```bash
-H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Ensure that the API key has sufficient credits for both uploads and downloads, as DataView uses a **credit-based billing system**.

---

## 💡 Final Notes

- **Efficient Data Flow:** DataView supports both direct file uploads and JSON-based automation for seamless integrations.  
- **Flexible Formats:** Compatible with common file types, ensuring smooth document conversions.  
- **Secure Access:** API key authentication and credit-based billing for controlled usage.

---

## 📊 Usage

### 🔑 API Key Management

The core model for authentication and billing is the **`ApiKey`** model, which is linked to a specific **`User`**.  
Each `ApiKey` includes the following properties:
- **`api_key`** – Auto-generated key used for authenticating API requests via the custom header `x-api-key`.  
- **`credits`** – A virtual currency used to track API usage. Credits are consumed based on data transfers during both uploads and downloads.

---

### 💡 **Billing Example**

Consider the following scenario where a user uploads a document and later downloads the converted PDF file.

#### **Scenario:**
- **Upload:** A document with a size of **5 MB (5120 KB)** is uploaded for conversion.  
- **Download:** The converted PDF file has a size of **1.2 MB (1229 KB)** and is downloaded.

#### **Billing Configuration:**

```python
billing = {
    'chunk_KB': 10,
    'credits': 0.1,
    'min_chunk_KB': 10
}
```

- **`chunk_KB = 10`** – Credits are charged for every 10 KB of data transferred.  
- **`credits = 0.1`** – Each 10 KB chunk costs **0.1 credit**.  
- **`min_chunk_KB = 10`** – The minimum data size charged is 10 KB, even for smaller files.

---

#### **📤 Upload Calculation (5 MB file):**

1. **File Size:** 5120 KB  
2. **Chunks:** 5120 KB ÷ 10 KB = **512 chunks**  
3. **Credits Charged:** 512 × 0.1 = **51.2 credits**

---

#### **📥 Download Calculation (1.2 MB file):**

1. **File Size:** 1229 KB  
2. **Chunks:** 1229 KB ÷ 10 KB = **123 chunks** (rounded up)  
3. **Credits Charged:** 123 × 0.1 = **12.3 credits**

---

### ✅ **Total Credits Charged**

- **Upload:** 51.2 credits  
- **Download:** 12.3 credits  

**Total Credits Used:** **63.5 credits**

---

### ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- **Credits are calculated before processing the request.**  
- If the user does not have enough credits, the API will return an error **before** uploading or downloading starts.  
- **Minimum chunk size applies:** Even files smaller than 10 KB will be charged as 1 full chunk (0.1 credit).  

---

### 🚨 **Example Error (Insufficient Credits):**

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient credits. Please top up your account.",
  "required_credits": 63.5,
  "available_credits": 40.0
}
```
- **`required_credits`** – Number of credits needed to process the request.  
- **`available_credits`** – Current credit balance of the API key.

In this case, the user had **40 credits**, which is insufficient for the total cost of **63.5 credits**.  
The request will be rejected until the user tops up their credits.

---

### 📈 API Request Billing History

Every API request is logged using the **`ApiKeyCreditHistory`** model. This provides detailed tracking of API usage for billing purposes.

#### **Tracked Information:**
- **API Key** used for the request  
- **Date and Time** of the request  
- **Requested Endpoint** with query parameters  
- **Response Size** (in KB)  
- **Chunk Size** (from the model’s `billing` property at the time of the request)  
- **Number of Chunks** generated  
- **Credit Cost per Chunk** (from the model’s `billing` property)  
- **Total Credits Charged** for the request  
- **Credit Balance Before Charge**  
- **IP Address** of the requester  
- **Unique Request Identifier** (as stored in system logs)  

---

### 💳 Top-up Credits

To add credits to an API key, the system uses the **`ApiKeyCreditTopUp`** model.

#### **Top-up Details Tracked:**
- **API Key** to which the credits are applied  
- **Credits Added** to the API key’s current balance  
- **Date and Time** of the top-up transaction  

Credits are immediately available after a successful top-up, allowing uninterrupted API usage.

---

## 💳 Billing System

DataView uses a **credit-based billing system** to track API usage:  
- **Credits** are consumed for both **uploading data** (e.g., emails, attachments) and **downloading converted PDFs**.  
- **Billing is user-specific**, based on the API key associated with each account.  
- Credit consumption is proportional to data size and processing demands.  

If there are insufficient credits, API requests will return an error with status code **402 (Payment Required)**.
